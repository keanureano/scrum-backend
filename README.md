# Scrum Tracker Backend API

Welcome to the Scrum Tracker Backend API, This Spring Boot application is a simple but powerful RESTful API with JWT authentication.
This API serves as a reliable backend foundation for our Scrum management project.

## Endpoints

### Register User

Register a new user with email, name, and password.

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register
Origin: http://localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "email",
  "name": "name",
  "password": "password"
}
```

### Login User

Login with email and password to obtain an authentication token.

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login
Origin: http://localhost:3000
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "email",
  "password": "password"
}
```

### Retrieve Data

To retrieve data from the API, you'll need to use a valid JWT token obtained from the registration or login process.

```http
GET http://localhost:8080/api
Origin: http://localhost:3000
Authorization: Bearer {TOKEN}
```

Make sure you have successfully registered or logged in to obtain the `{TOKEN}` and replace it in the request header for authorization. This token will grant you access to the protected endpoints of the API.
